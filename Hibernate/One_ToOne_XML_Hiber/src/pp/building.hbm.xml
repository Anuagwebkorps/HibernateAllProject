<!-- cascade="all" Cascading is a feature in Hibernate, which is used to manage the state of the mapped entity whenever 
the state of its relationship owner (superclass) affected. When the relationship owner (superclass) is 
saved/ deleted, then the mapped entity associated with it should also be saved/ deleted automatically -->
